### Idea
    A ChatBot ready to connect and read streamers' chat in a UI.
Simply provide a generated token from Twitch Token Generator, the channel name, and the account name being used for the bot.

### Python
    The code was written in Python and using libraries (Tkinter, socket, ssl and threading)

### Updates
    The idea for this code is developing some updates in future. Is the first one I update and i take it like a practice and a beginning.
    Any feedback or suggestions are welcome ^^
